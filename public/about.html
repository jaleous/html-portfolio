I also use some other sources to learn.When I started this journey I knew for a person who never coded before it will not be so easy and I promised myself that I will not give up.
I believe that with good strategies, hard work and consistency an individual can achieve their goals. I love problem-solving and using my creativity for the situations.It's really exciting to grow in technology world and my goal is to make user-friendly and functional websites by enjoying the journey.
